## Summary

My Portofolio Page re-created using the Bootstrap framework (v4.3).
This demonstrated the speed at which a styled webpage can be built when using a UI framework,
however it also highlighted some of the difficulties in then trying to customise away from the framework.

## Tech / Frameworks / Libraries Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap (v4.3)
